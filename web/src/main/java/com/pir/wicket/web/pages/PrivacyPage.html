    This website is owned and operated by Winito Inc. We are
    committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact
    with the content, products and services on this site (the "Site"). This
    Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply to other
    websites to which we link. Because we gather certain types of
    information about our users, we want you to understand what information
    we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used,
    and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of
    the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not
    agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
</p><br/>

<p>
    <strong>1) Information Collected</strong>
    We collect two types of information from you: i) information
    that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through a voluntary
    registration process, sign-ups or emails); and ii) information that is
    derived through automated tracking mechanisms.
    a) Voluntary Registration Information
    In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete
    the registration process, during which we will collect personal
    information about you. The information will include your name, address,
    and email address and other optional information that you may choose to
    give us. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you
    except when you specifically provide such information to us on a
    voluntary basis.
    By registering with us, you consent to the use and method of
    disclosure as described in this Privacy Policy.
    b)Cookies
    Our site uses "cookies" and other tracking technologies.
    Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them
    to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies,
    including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a
    user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire,
    forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This
    prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are
    away from their computer.
    You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a
    cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please
    note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need
    to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain
    parts of the Site.
    Third-Party Cookies: In the course of serving
    advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or
    recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
